# Programming Research Algorithms Assignments Repository

### This course has two types of assignments:
1. [Python](Python) (programming assignments in Python)
2. [Reseach](Reseach) (implementing the research algorithms in Python)

## The reseach I'm working on and implementing his algorithms is [Hybrid recursive number partitioning (Korf, 2011)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&type=pdf&doi=10.1.1.208.2132)
