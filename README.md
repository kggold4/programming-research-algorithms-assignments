# <i>Programming Research Algorithms Assignments</i>

## Paper:
* The reseach I'm working on and implementing his algorithms is [Hybrid recursive number partitioning (Korf, 2011)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&type=pdf&doi=10.1.1.208.2132)
* You can see my hebrew summary for this research in [Research Summary](https://github.com/kggold4/programming-research-algorithms-assignments/blob/main/Research/Ex1/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9D%20%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8.pdf)

## This course has two types of assignments:
1. [Python](Python) (programming assignments in Python)
2. [Research](Research) (implementing the research algorithms in Python)

## Assignments list:
### Python:
1. [Ex0](Python/Ex0)
2. [Ex2](Python/Ex2)
3. [Ex4](Python/Ex4)

### Research:
1. [Ex1](Research/Ex1)
