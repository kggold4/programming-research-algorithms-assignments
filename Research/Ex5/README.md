1. Read the [Ex5](https://github.com/kggold4/programming-research-algorithms-assignments/blob/main/Research/Ex5/Ex5.pdf) pdf file
2. See the module I've forked [kggold4/prtpy](https://github.com/kggold4/prtpy) (the algorithms I will implement purpose is to be combined in this repository)
3. See the clone I've did to the module [prtpy](https://github.com/kggold4/programming-research-algorithms-assignments/tree/main/Research/Ex5/clone%20prtpy)
4. See the venv I've created [.myvenv](https://github.com/kggold4/programming-research-algorithms-assignments/tree/main/Research/Ex5/myvenv/.myvenv)
5. See the algorithms titles and signatures in [algorithms.py](https://github.com/kggold4/programming-research-algorithms-assignments/blob/main/Research/Ex5/algorithms.py) file
6. See the algorithms unit tests in [test_algorithms.py](https://github.com/kggold4/programming-research-algorithms-assignments/blob/main/Research/Ex5/tests/test_algorithms.py) file
7. See the main file that will run algorithms in Callable way [main.py](https://github.com/kggold4/programming-research-algorithms-assignments/blob/main/Research/Ex5/main.py)
